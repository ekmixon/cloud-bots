## sg_delete_not_matching_cidr
What it does: Deletes all rules on a security group , that have the given port and have a scope outside the given cidr
        * following GSL - SecurityGroup should not have inboundRules contain [ port<=x and portTo>=x and scope!= y  ]

Usage: sg_delete_not_matching_cidr <port> <cidr> <direction>

Parameters:
    port: number
    scope: a.b.c.d/e
    direction: inbound/ outbound


Example:

    sg_delete_not_matching_cidr 22 10.163.0.0/16 inbound

    *all the sg's rules with port 22 that have scope with range outside of 10.163.0.0/16 scope ,  will be deleted

Notes :

    -  before running this bot, ensure that your applications will work correctly without those rules
    - if a port is in a port range and there is a mismatch in cidr the rule will be deleted ( with all the other port in range )

Limitations: IPv6 is not supported yet
