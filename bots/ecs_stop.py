## ecs_stop
What it does: stops an ecs tasks and ec2 instances which contain the tasks
Usage: AUTO: ecs_stop
Sample GSL: cloudtrail where event.name='RegisterTaskDefinition' and event.status='Success'
Limitations: none

Bot doesn't change services fields, number of required tasks field as well.
Since some tasks can be activated without a service.
Draining the instances related to the tasks prevents the service from creating tasks even if field of required tasks not set to 0.
