## sg_rules_delete_by_scope
What it does: Deletes all rules on a security group with a scope(cidr) containing or equal to a given scope,
             port and protocol are optional

Usage: sg_rules_delete_by_scope <scope> <direction> <port|*> <protocol|*>

Parameters:
    scope: a.b.c.d/e
    direction: inbound/ outbound
    port: number/ *
    protocol: TCP/ UDP/ *
-When '*' is any value of the parameter

Examples:
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 0.0.0.0/0 inbound 22 tcp

    all rules with 1.0.0.0/16 scope will be deleted for any port and protocol:
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 1.0.0.0/16 inbound * *

    all rules with 0.0.0.0/0 scope will be deleted for port 22 and any protocol:
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 0.0.0.0/0 inbound 22 *

Notes :
    - the bot deletes the rule without splitting ports ( do not create new rules without the deleted port)
      for deleting rule with split use - sg_single_rule_delete bot .
    -  before running this bot, ensure that your applications will work correctly without those rules
    - if a port is in a port range the rule wont be deleted ! use * on port parameter to delete the rule for any port
Limitations: IPv6 is not supported
